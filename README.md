# Fitbit Air Notification Bridge

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

An experimental, unofficial Android bridge that turns selected phone notifications into short, recognizable haptic patterns on Fitbit Air.

The project is based on Fitbit's Apache-2.0-licensed [Golden Gate](https://github.com/Fitbit/golden-gate) transport stack. It uses BLE, Gattlink, DTLS/CoAP and a locally processed Android `NotificationListenerService`. No cloud relay is required.

> **Alpha software.** The protocol has been validated on one Fitbit Air. It is not an official Fitbit or Google product. Do not use it for medical, emergency, or safety-critical alerts.

## Current capabilities

- Connect to Fitbit Air over Golden Gate/Gattlink.
- Establish the device's BOOTSTRAP DTLS session.
- Read the current haptic intensity through `PUT /settings`.
- Produce a bounded short-vibration group by changing the intensity and restoring it after 800 ms.
- Verify that the final device setting matches the original setting.
- Monitor up to five Android application packages.
- Assign one of five patterns to each application: `single`, `double`, `triple`, `long_gap`, or `urgent`.
- Filter group summaries, ongoing notifications, self-notifications and recent duplicate content.

Example rules:

```text
com.tencent.mm=single
org.telegram.messenger=double
com.whatsapp=long_gap
```

## Important limitations

- The current alpha keeps the BLE/CoAP connection in the visible connection activity. Background foreground-service ownership and automatic reconnect are the next milestone.
- Only `arm64-v8a` is built at present.
- A pattern is composed of verified **toggle/restore haptic groups**. It is not arbitrary motor waveform control.
- Fitbit Air normally cannot be actively connected by this app and Google Health at the same time.

## Privacy and security

- Notification content is inspected only in memory for duplicate suppression.
- Rules are stored locally with Android `SharedPreferences`.
- Notification bodies, device keys and user data are not sent to a server by this project.
- This repository intentionally contains no Google Health APK, extracted proprietary code, credentials or device keys.

## Build

The Android app is under `platform/android/goldengate`. The inherited Golden Gate build currently uses Gradle 6.9.1, Android Gradle Plugin 4.1.0, JDK 11, Android SDK 30, NDK 23.0.7599858 and CMake 3.10.2.

Build the Golden Gate Android core first, then run:

```bash
cd platform/android/goldengate
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:assembleDebug
```

The debug APK is written to `platform/android/goldengate/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

See [Golden Gate's Android build documentation](docs/src/platforms/android.md) for native toolchain setup.

## Roadmap

1. Move BLE/DTLS/CoAP ownership into an Android foreground service.
2. Persist the selected Air and reconnect automatically.
3. Replace package-name text rules with an installed-app picker for 3–5 rules.
4. Add a visual pattern editor, cooldown controls and a safe preview button.
5. Publish reproducible GitHub Actions builds and signed release APKs.
